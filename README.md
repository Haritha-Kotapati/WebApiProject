# WebApiProject

This is my first C# project. I have used the following kind of examples to get practiced.

Tested the controllers with apis.
1. Returns 10 more than the integer input {id}.
2. Returns the square of the integer input {id}.
3. Returns the string “Hello World!”
4. Returns the string “Greetings to {id} people!” where id is an integer value.
5. Create a method which has an input {id}, and applies four mathematical operations to it.
6. You are charging your client $5.50 / FN (fortnight = 14 days) for web hosting and maintenance, plus an additional 13% HST. The input {id} represents 
the number of days which has elapsed since the beginning of the hosting. Output 3 strings which describe the total hosting cost. 
(The above 6th one needs a revision, where I could reduce the number of lines in the code and make it even more shorter with logic).
7. Test the github push, save changes and push again.
